## Micro web application

A Micro web application is a directory having the following simple structure:

    app_name
     - WEB-INF
       - classes
       - lib
       - config
       - controllers
       - views
         - content
         - templates

The structure above is the proposed layout, Micro allowing you to organize your files with a greater flexibility.
