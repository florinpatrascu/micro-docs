## Helpers

Helpers are context utility objects that are available throughout the entire request processing chain; models, controllers and views. The helpers are loaded at startup and automatically introduced in the context the moment a web request is received. They remain in the context until the response is finalized.

Micro is deliberately coming with a short list of helpers and the user is encouraged to write their own and eventually contribute the code to the Micro project. A list with the known helpers can be found here: [Helpers catalog](/helpers/)
